    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This chicken and quinoa recipe is incredibly easy, delicious, and spicy! Taste-test approved by a very picky 3-year-old.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 cup quinoa</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vegetable oil, or as needed</li>
        <li>1/2 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, or to taste, minced</li>
        <li>1 ½ pounds ground chicken</li>
        <li>1 ½ (10 ounce) cans diced tomatoes with green chile peppers </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring chicken broth and quinoa to a boil in a saucepan. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until quinoa is tender and water has been absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Sauté onion and garlic in hot oil until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Add ground chicken; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir cooked quinoa and diced tomatoes into chicken mixture; bring to a simmer and cook long enough for flavors to meld, about 10 minutes more.</li>
    </ol>
